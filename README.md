### Fraud and expected fraud in crypto

 ## FTX observations:

- Daily trading volume of Bitcoin USDT Futures on Binance is multiple times bigger than FTX USD perpetual contract.

- Starting on October 25th 2022, after Bitcoin consolidated/ranged for months, it had a massive upside move (relative to recent PA)

- FTX started showing massive amounts of liquidation... but not just bears

- It started printing more liquidations than trades
 
- Series of 2.5k$ Bull liquidations on bullish PA (These occurd during both upswings and downswings and were quick, seemingly making no sense.

- Millions of dollars more than any other exchange in liquidations (even though usual trading volume is a fraction of Binance)

- Series of 200-400k$ liquidations from both bulls and bears, that seemingly made no sense at all (Large liquidations that did not correlate with price action)

Update* November 11 2022:

Condolonces to FTX users.

Contagion will be widespread and rapid, with chapter 11's being filed already, billions of U.S dollars where no knows the where abouts, BTC trading below relevant local lows made back in June and finally the countless other parties associated with FTX/Alameda, such as: BlockFi, Genesis and more than 100 other entities associated with FTX/Alameda both off and on the books.

In conslusion, you have no idea the transparency needed when dealing in finance. For crypto specifically, from an investor's mindset, it is very hard to participate given the climate. The bottom line is this: With leverage in crypto no one knows how much money there is...
