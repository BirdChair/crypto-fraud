Potential cases of fraud in crypto

- Daily trading volume of Bitcoin USDT Futures on Binance is multiple times bigger than FTX USD perpetual contract.

- Starting on October 25th 2022, after Bitcoin consolidated/ranged for months, it had a massive upside move (relative to recent PA)

-FTX started showing massive amounts of liquidation... but not just bears

-It started printing more liquidations than trades

-Series of 2.5k$ Bull liquidations on bullish PA

-Millions of dollars more than any other exchange in liquidations

-Series of 200-400k$ liquidations from both bulls and bears, that seemingly made no sense at all

Update* November 11 2022:

Condolonces to FTX users (what is FDIC insured mean, again?), the lines in the sand were drawn and all I had to do was look at order flow, basically. 

Contagion will be widespread and rapid, with chapter 11's being filed already, billions of U.S dollars where no knows the where abouts, BTC trading below relevant local lows made back in June and finally the countless other parties associated with FTX/Alameda, such as: BlockFi, Genesis and more than 100 more counter parties associated with these bankruptcy proceedings.
