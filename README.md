Potential cases of fraud in crypto

- Daily trading volume of Bitcoin USDT Futures on Binance is multiple times bigger than FTX USD perpetual contract.

- Starting on October 25th 2022, after Bitcoin consolidated/ranged for months, it had a massive upside move (relative to recent PA)

-FTX started showing massive amounts of liquidation... but not just bears

-It started printing more liquidations than trades

-Series of 2.5k$ Bull liquidations on bullish PA

-Millions of dollars more than any other exchange in liquidations

-Series of 200-400k$ liquidations from both bulls and bears, that seemingly made no sense at all
